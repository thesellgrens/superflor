        <h3>Superman (2025)</h3>
        <p><em>“You’ll believe in hope again.”</em></p>
        <p>
            Directed by James Gunn and starring David Corenswet as Clark Kent,
            <strong>Superman (2025)</strong> launches the new DC Universe.
            Already three years into his heroic journey, Superman struggles to balance
            his Kryptonian heritage with his human upbringing while battling Lex Luthor’s
            schemes to tarnish his reputation. With Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) by his side
            and new allies like Hawkgirl and Mr. Terrific, this film redefines the Man of Steel
            for a new era.
